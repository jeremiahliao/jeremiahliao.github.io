                        Hello! My name is <strong>Jeremiah Liao.</strong> I am from San Diego, CA. However, I also call Taiwan my home since 
                        I lived there for 3 years when I was younger. Currently, I am studying 
                        at <strong>California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo</strong> as a 2nd year Computer Science major.
                        Sme of the classes I've taken include: <em>Data Structures in Python</em>, 
                        <em>Object Orriented Programming in Java</em>, <em>Systems Programming in C</em>, <em>Introduction to Software
                        Engineering</em>, <em>Design & Analysis of Computer Algorithms</em>. Outside of class, some of the tools/experiences 
                        that I have include: <em>React.js</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Shopify Liquid</em>, 
                        <em>Git</em>, <em>Linux/Unix</em>. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Outside of school and work, some of the hobbies I enjoy doing include going to the gym, playing sports such as golf and basketball, 
                        cooking, as well as playing music with other people (I play drums, guitar, and piano). I am someone who always enjoys learning
                        new skills and trying out new experiences. Lately, I've been experiementing with new recipes such as making a Spanish Paella from
                        scratch!
